## Codebase Patterns

<!-- Add reusable patterns discovered during development here. Example:
- "Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations"
- "Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations"
- "Export types from actions.ts for UI components"
-->

- (add reusable patterns here)

## Known Issues & Gotchas

<!-- Document problems encountered that future iterations should be aware of. Example:
- "PowerShell `Set-Content` strips em-dashes from strings — use file creation tools instead"
- "The CI pipeline requires Node 18+ — don't use Node 16 APIs"
-->

## Blockers

<!-- Document anything that is currently blocking progress. Remove when resolved (but keep a note that it was resolved). -->

## Deferred Tasks

<!-- If a TODO was found but intentionally deferred, document the reason here so future iterations don't re-prioritize it. -->
