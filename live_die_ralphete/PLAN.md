# Plan

> This file holds the high-level plan for the current working session.
> The orchestrator agent writes and updates this file at the beginning of each loop.
> Each iteration should read this file first to understand the overall direction.

## Current Goal

<!-- Describe the current high-level objective here -->

_No active plan. The orchestrator agent will populate this on first run._

## Approach

<!-- How will we achieve the goal? Break it into phases if needed. -->

## Context & Decisions

<!-- Record key decisions, trade-offs, and rationale here so future iterations understand *why*, not just *what*. -->

## Dependencies & Blockers

<!-- Note anything that blocks progress. Move persistent problems to PERSISTANCE.md. -->
