> Tasks flow from PLAN.md → here → done.

## Bootstrap Tasks (resolve before starting feature work)

> The agent MUST scan all project files for TODO/FIXME comments and list them here before doing anything else.

<!-- These will be populated by the agent on first run -->

## Feature Tasks

<!-- Derived from PLAN.md — the agent breaks the plan into small, iteration-sized tasks here -->
