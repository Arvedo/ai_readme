# Contributors

The project differentiates between 3 levels of contributors:

- Contributors: people who have contributed before (no special privileges)
- Collaborators (Triage): people with significant contributions, who may be responsible for some parts of the code, and are expected to maintain and review contributions for the code they own
- Maintainers: responsible for reviewing and merging PRs, after approval from the code owners

# AI Usage Policy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project does **not** accept pull requests that are fully or predominantly AI-generated. AI tools may be utilized solely in an assistive capacity.
>
> Detailed information regarding permissible and restricted uses of AI can be found in the [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) file.

Code that is initially generated by AI and subsequently edited will still be considered AI-generated. AI assistance is permissible only when the majority of the code is authored by a human contributor, with AI employed exclusively for corrections or to expand on verbose modifications that the contributor has already conceptualized (e.g., generating repeated lines with minor variations).

If AI is used to generate any portion of the code, contributors must adhere to the following requirements:

1. Explicitly disclose the manner in which AI was employed.
2. Perform a comprehensive manual review prior to submitting the pull request.
3. Be prepared to explain every line of code they submitted when asked about it by a maintainer.
4. Using AI to write pull request descriptions or to respond to human reviewers is strictly prohibited.

For more info, please refer to the [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) file.

# Pull requests (for contributors & collaborators)

Before submitting your PR:
- Search for existing PRs to prevent duplicating efforts
- Test your changes:
    - If your change is not covered by existing tests, add new tests to cover it
    - If your change breaks existing tests, fix the underlying issue and make sure all tests pass before submitting the PR
- Create separate PRs for each feature or fix:
    - Avoid combining unrelated changes in a single PR
    - For intricate features, consider opening a feature request first to discuss and align expectations
- Consider allowing write access to your branch for faster reviews, as reviewers can push commits directly

After submitting your PR:
- Expect requests for modifications to ensure the code meets all standards for quality and long-term maintainability
- Maintainers will rely on your insights and approval when making a final decision to approve and merge a PR
- If your PR becomes stale, rebase it on top of latest `master` to get maintainers attention
- Consider adding yourself to [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) to indicate your availability for fixing related issues and reviewing related PRs

# Pull requests (for maintainers)

- Squash-merge PRs
- Use the following format for the squashed commit title: `<module> : <commit title> (#<issue_number>)`. For example: `utils : fix typo in utils.py (#1234)`
- Optionally pick a `<module>` from here: [modules.md](docs/modules.md)
- Let other maintainers merge their own PRs
- When merging a PR, make sure you have a good understanding of the changes
- Be mindful of maintenance: most of the work going into a feature happens after the PR is merged. If the PR author is not committed to contribute long-term, someone else needs to take responsibility (you)

Maintainers reserve the right to decline review or close pull requests for any reason, particularly under any of the following conditions:
- The proposed change is already mentioned in the roadmap or an existing issue, and it has been assigned to someone.
- The pull request duplicates an existing one.
- The contributor fails to adhere to this contributing guide.

# Coding guidelines

- Avoid adding third-party dependencies, extra files, extra headers, etc.
- Always consider cross-compatibility with other operating systems and architectures
- Avoid fancy-looking modern STL constructs, use basic `for` loops, avoid templates, keep it simple
- Vertical alignment makes things more readable and easier to batch edit


- Try to follow the existing patterns in the code (indentation, spaces, etc.). 
- When in doubt, prefer readability over cleverness
- When adding new code, consider the long-term maintenance cost

# Naming guidelines

# Preprocessor directives

-- TODO: add the right guidelines here

# Code maintenance

- Existing code should have designated collaborators and/or maintainers specified in the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) file reponsible for:
  - Reviewing and merging related PRs
  - Fixing related bugs
  - Providing developer guidance/support

- When adding or modifying a large piece of code:
  - If you are a collaborator, make sure to add yourself to [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) to indicate your availability for reviewing related PRs
  - If you are a contributor, find an existing collaborator who is willing to review and maintain your code long-term

- New code should follow the guidelines (coding, naming, etc.) outlined in this document. Exceptions are allowed on request, but must be approved by a maintainer.


# Documentation

- Documentation is a community effort
- Everyone is encouraged to contribute to the documentation and uses JavaDoc/Doxygen style comments in the code
- When you need to look into the source code to figure out how to use an API consider adding a short summary to the header file for future reference
- When you notice incorrect or outdated documentation, please update it
